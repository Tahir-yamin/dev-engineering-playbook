# 📌 REMINDER: Option 2 - MCP Server Upgrade

**Status**: Pending - Do this AFTER Option 1 is tested and working

## What is Option 2?

Convert the Gemini job search into an **MCP Server** that can be used by:
- Antigravity (this AI assistant)
- Other tools and workflows
- Multiple job search scenarios

## Benefits of MCP Server:

1. **Reusable** - Use Gemini search across all your workflows
2. **Cleaner** - Proper server architecture
3. **Shareable** - Can be published for others
4. **Integrated** - Built into Antigravity's ecosystem

## When to Implement:

- ✅ After Option 1 works successfully
- ✅ After you've used it for 1-2 weeks
- ✅ If you want to use Gemini search in other workflows
- ✅ If direct integration feels too manual

## Estimated Time:

- **1-2 hours** to convert to MCP server
- Includes server setup, testing, integration

## Location:

Would be created at:
```
C:\Users\Administrator\.gemini\antigravity\servers\gemini-job-search\
  ├── server.py
  ├── __init__.py
  └── README.md
```

**Action Required**: User will decide when to upgrade to Option 2
