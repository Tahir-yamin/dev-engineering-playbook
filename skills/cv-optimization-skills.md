# CV Optimization Skills - Recruiter Insights 2025

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Best Practices

### 1. Format Rules
- **Use DOCX format** (not PDF) - better ATS parsing
- **Simple formatting only** - no tables, columns, text boxes, headers/footers
- **Standard fonts** - Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman (10-12pt)
- **Standard section headers** - Professional Summary, Experience, Education, Skills
- **No images, graphics, or icons** - ATS can't read them

### 2. Keyword Optimization (Critical!)
```
RECRUITER INSIGHT: "I spend 6 seconds on a CV. Keywords are my filter."
```

**Strategy:**
1. Copy job description keywords EXACTLY
2. Include both acronyms AND full terms: "PMP (Project Management Professional)"
3. Match job title exactly in Professional Summary
4. Use industry-standard terminology

**High-Value Keywords for Project Controls:**
- Primavera P6 (not just "P6")
- Earned Value Management (EVM)
- Critical Path Method (CPM)
- Schedule Risk Analysis
- Delay Analysis (EOT/Claims)
- FIDIC Contract Administration
- Cost Control & Forecasting
- Progress Measurement
- Baseline Management
- S-Curve / Histogram

### 3. Quantify Everything
```
RECRUITER INSIGHT: "Numbers catch my eye. Vague descriptions don't."
```

**Template:**
- "Managed X projects worth $Y million"
- "Led team of X planners/engineers"
- "Reduced schedule variance by X%"
- "Delivered X% cost savings"
- "Controlled portfolio of X+ activities"

**Examples:**
❌ "Managed large projects"
✅ "Managed 5 EPC projects worth USD 750M combined"

❌ "Worked with planning team"
✅ "Led 15-engineer planning team across 3 offshore projects"

### 4. Action Verbs (Power Words)
**Leadership:** Led, Directed, Managed, Orchestrated, Spearheaded
**Technical:** Developed, Implemented, Analyzed, Optimized, Integrated
**Delivery:** Delivered, Achieved, Exceeded, Accelerated, Completed
**Commercial:** Supported, Advised, Defended, Negotiated, Evaluated

### 5. Structure Priority (What Recruiters Read First)

```
RECRUITER INSIGHT: "Top third of page 1 is prime real estate."
```

**Order of Importance:**
1. **Name + Title** (match job title)
2. **Professional Summary** (3-4 lines, keyword-rich)
3. **Core Competencies** (2-column bullet list)
4. **Most Recent Experience** (first 2 bullets matter most)

### 6. Tailoring Strategy Per Job

**Quick Tailor Checklist:**
1. [ ] Match job title in header
2. [ ] Mirror 5+ keywords from JD in summary
3. [ ] Reorder experience bullets to match JD priorities
4. [ ] Add company-specific language if known
5. [ ] Highlight relevant industry experience

## Cover Letter Best Practices

### Modern Style (2025)
```
RECRUITER INSIGHT: "Short, confident, specific. No generic fluff."
```

**Structure:**
1. **Opening Hook** (1 sentence) - State role + your #1 differentiator
2. **Value Proposition** (3 bullets) - Top 3 relevant achievements
3. **Company Interest** (1 sentence) - Specific reason for this company
4. **Call to Action** (1 sentence) - Confident close

**Length:** 200-300 words max

**Avoid:**
- "I am writing to apply..." (boring opener)
- "I believe I would be a great fit..." (generic)
- "As you can see from my CV..." (redundant)
