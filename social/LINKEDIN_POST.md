**2024 Wrapped: From 15+ Years in Planning & Scheduling to Embracing AI** 🎯

As 2024 ends and 2025 begins, I'm pausing to reflect on an **incredible year of transformation**.

For over 15 years, I've been a **Planning & Scheduling Engineer**—mastering timelines, resources, and deliverables. But this year? I decided to schedule something new: **my own evolution into the world of AI**.

**✨ 2024 Highlights:**

🏆 **Hackathon Phase IV Submitted!**
What started as a simple learning project became a full **cloud-native application** with Kubernetes, Docker, and AI integration. Over 70,000 words of documentation written. A year of coding culminated in hitting that **Submit** button. 🎉

📊 **Power BI & Microsoft Fabric Expertise**
Explored the depths of business intelligence, building dashboards that don't just display data—they **tell stories**.

🤖 **Machine Learning Journey Begun**
From understanding algorithms to appreciating the magic of models—I'm hooked.

👁️ **Computer Vision Curiosity**
The idea of machines "seeing" the world and solving real-world problems? Absolutely fascinating. This is where I want to go deeper.

🦾 **Robotics Fascination**
From manual operations to **autonomous, conscious-level robotics**—the recent developments in humanoid robots and AI-driven automation have captured my imagination completely.

🔐 **Cybersecurity Foundations**
Took my first steps into security, though the path wasn't clear. A topic I'll revisit with more focus.

**🌟 My 2025 Vision & Accountability Pledge:**

This year, I'm unlocking myself to:
- **Data Science**: Deep statistical analysis & insights.
- **Machine Learning**: Moving from theory to production models.
- **Computer Vision**: Solving real-world problems with AI eyes.
- **Robotics**: Bridging my engineering roots with autonomous systems.

And here's my promise to myself:
> **I will come back at the end of 2025 and measure my progress.**

No more vague goals. This year is about **exponential growth**, not incremental steps.

To everyone who has been part of this journey—mentors, the open-source community, and fellow learners—**thank you**. The transition from scheduling projects to scheduling neural network training isn't easy, but it's the most exciting challenge I've ever taken on.

Here's to a year of building, learning, and growing. 🥂

See you at the end of 2025. Let's see how far we've come. 🚀
